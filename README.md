I've started coding for real back in 2017, when I created [Yui](https://github.com/HKGx/Yui) for my friends on Discord. It wasn't the greatest but it did work. 
Programming quite quickly became my hobby and I've dedicated many many hours to it.


Back in 2022, I've did an internship at [OmniCalculator](https://www.omnicalculator.com/).

  - A simple [personal static site](https://hkgx.github.io/HKGx/)
  - [rendertex](https://github.com/HKGx/rendertex) rework, because I cannot stand it is so barebone
  - I spent some time implementing monadic *Maybe* in Python: [perhaps](https://github.com/HKGx/perhaps)
