I've started coding for real back in 2017, when I created [Yui](https://github.com/HKGx/Yui) for my friends on Discord. It wasn't the greatest but it did work. 
Programming quite quickly became my hobby and I've dedicated many many hours to it.


This year, 2022, I've did an internship at [OmniCalculator](https://www.omnicalculator.com/) and just recently I have started studying at Łódź University of Technology.
